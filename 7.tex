In the previous sections,
we have established the basic properties of quasi-categories.
From now on, our terminology will change from ``quasi-categories''
to ``$(\infty,1)$-categories'', or ``$\infty$-categories'' for short.
This means that we are not only studying one particular model;
we are also talking about the behaviour of an intrinsic notion of $(\infty,1)$-categories,
and their properties should be independent of models.

By an \term{$\infty$-category}, we refer to a quasi-category.
However, with this different terminology, we are implying that they can also be replaced by
categories enriched over Kan complexes, or any other model for $(\infty,1)$-categories,
although we only provide rigorous formulations for quasi-categories.
